1: Biggest predictor of CO2 output

The highest correlation value is observed when considering CO2 and GDP at global value.

2: Biggest strides in decreasing CO2 output

part 1
I wrote a code that gives the maximum, everage and minimum yearly change in CO2 omissions per capita per country.
In the code this is currently done for China, United States and Italy. Positive means rise, Negative means decline

part 2
I also include a search for the 5 countries with the best average decline and most extreme decline in the last decade.
This is actually not that informative since theyt tend to be countries that were not polluting much to begin with

part 3

this part carries out the same search but only on the top 20 polluters, defined as the 20 countries with the highest CO2
per capita


3: Best future price for non-fossil fuel energy

I spent 3 hours looking for usable data, but I could not find any. I assume the purpose is to show I can perform a linear
regression, so I sed oil data. First, the data are  plotted, then the linear regression is given and then the user can enter
a date in teh future to get the predicted price
