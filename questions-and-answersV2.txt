1: Biggest predictor of CO2 output

- The data are now loaded from the github repository
- I also added visualization for GDP and GDP per capita including a regression line
- I am not sure what other data should be used, I am guessing if the point is to show how you can do a correlation matrix
anything would do, so I used dietary information. I now print  a correlation matrix including direction of the correlation
p-value and significance. The whole idea is problematic anyway because correlation per se has no significance (pun intended)

I guess the conclusion would be that the secret to lowering CO2 emissions is becoming poor, modulo the problem that poor people
might choose meat over vegetables since meat is often cheaper


2: Biggest strides in decreasing CO2 output

No changes here as I do not think anything was required


3: Best future price for non-fossil fuel energy

I now use the data that were provided. They are loaded from the github repository

If data from the country chosen by the user are available, those data are used, otherwise data for WORLD are used.
first graph plots actual prices, later graph report actual prices and linear regressions for each energy source
The user can then specify the year for which they are interested in predicting prices and the predicted price is
calculated. If predicted price is negative it is reported as being virtually 0.
